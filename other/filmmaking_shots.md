### Wide and Distance Shots

1. **Extreme Wide Shot**: The camera is very far from the subject, often showing vast landscapes or large scenes. It’s used to show the setting or the scale of a location. The subject may not even be visible, or if they are, they're very small.

2. **Long Shot**: The subject is visible in full from a distance, with a lot of the surroundings also in view. It helps to show the subject in relation to their environment.

3. **Wide Shot**: Similar to a long shot, but the subject takes up more of the frame, though the surroundings are still prominent. It's used to show both the subject and where they are.

4. **Full Shot**: The subject fills the frame from head to toe, showing the entire body but leaving some space around them. This shot is often used to focus on the subject while still including some of the environment.

5. **Medium Long Shot**: This shot frames the subject from the knees up, focusing more on the subject but still showing some background. It balances between showing the person and their environment.

6. **Medium Wide Shot**: Also known as a "cowboy shot" (see below), it typically shows the subject from mid-thighs up. It’s closer than a medium long shot but still includes some background.

7. **Cowboy Shot**: A variation of the medium wide shot that frames the subject from just above the knees to the head. It's called a cowboy shot because it was often used in Westerns to show a cowboy's gun holster.

8. **Medium Shot**: The subject is framed from the waist up. It’s one of the most common shots, focusing more on the subject than the background, perfect for dialogue scenes.

### Close-up Shots

9. **Medium Close-Up**: This shot frames the subject from the chest up, focusing more on the face while still showing some of the upper body. It’s used to show facial expressions clearly.

10. **Close-Up**: The subject's face fills the frame, showing just the head and sometimes the shoulders. This shot is used to capture emotions and facial details.

11. **Extreme Close-Up**: Focuses on a specific part of the subject, like just the eyes or mouth. It’s used to highlight details or emotions intensely.

### Purposeful Shots

12. **Establishing Shot**: A wide or extreme wide shot used at the beginning of a scene to show the location and set the context for the following action.

13. **Shallow Focus**: The subject is in sharp focus, while the background is blurred. This draws attention to the subject and isolates them from the surroundings.

14. **Deep Focus**: Both the subject and the background are in sharp focus. It allows the viewer to see all elements in the scene clearly.

15. **Tilt-Shift Soft Focus**: A shot where part of the image is in sharp focus, while the rest is intentionally blurred. It can create a miniature or dreamy effect.

### Angle Shots

16. **Eye Level Shot**: The camera is placed at the subject’s eye level, creating a neutral perspective that feels natural and straightforward.

17. **Low Angle Shot**: The camera is positioned below the subject, looking up. This shot makes the subject appear larger, more powerful, or intimidating.

18. **High Angle Shot**: The camera is positioned above the subject, looking down. This makes the subject appear smaller, weaker, or vulnerable.

19. **Hip Level Shot**: The camera is placed at the height of the subject's hip, often used in action scenes to show hand movements or holstered weapons.

20. **Knee Level Shot**: The camera is positioned at the subject’s knee level, giving a view from a low angle but higher than ground level. It can add tension or emphasize movement.

21. **Ground Level Shot**: The camera is placed directly on the ground. It’s often used to show feet or ground-level action, creating a sense of immediacy or intensity.

### Motion Shots

22. **Steadicam Shot**: The camera is stabilized with a Steadicam rig, allowing for smooth movement while following the subject. It’s often used for long, continuous takes that follow a character closely.

23. **Shoulder-Level Shot**: The camera is placed at the subject’s shoulder height, slightly higher than an eye-level shot, which can add a sense of authority or confidence.

24. **Dutch Angle Shot**: The camera is tilted on its axis, creating a diagonal horizon line. It’s used to create a sense of unease, disorientation, or tension.

25. **Birds-Eye-View Shot**: The camera is positioned high above the subject, looking straight down. This shot gives a god-like perspective, showing the entire scene from above.

26. **Overhead Shot**: Similar to a bird’s-eye view, but the camera might not be as high. It’s still above the subject, providing a top-down view that can focus on details of the setting or the arrangement of objects.

27. **Helicopter Shot**: A wide, moving shot captured from a helicopter, often used to show large landscapes or cityscapes from above. It’s used for dramatic, sweeping views.

28. **Worm’s Eye View**: The camera is placed extremely low, as if from the perspective of a worm looking up. This shot makes everything seem tall and imposing.

29. **Zoom Shot**: The camera zooms in or out on the subject without moving the camera itself. This can be used to bring focus to a detail or to reveal more of the scene.

30. **Pan Shot**: The camera moves horizontally (left to right or right to left) across the scene. It’s used to follow action or show a wide view of the environment.

31. **Crab Shot**: The camera moves sideways, typically on a track or dolly, following the subject from the side. It’s similar to a pan, but the entire camera moves instead of rotating.

32. **Arc Shot**: The camera moves in a circular motion around the subject, often used to create a dynamic, 360-degree view that adds energy to the scene.

33. **Handheld Shot**: The camera is held by the operator without stabilization, resulting in a shaky, realistic feel. It’s often used in action scenes or to create a documentary-style effect.

34. **Crane Shot**: The camera is mounted on a crane, allowing it to move up, down, and across large distances. It’s used for dramatic, sweeping movements that cover wide areas.

35. **Drone Shot**: Captured using a drone, this shot is often aerial, providing views similar to a helicopter shot but with more flexibility and closer to the ground.

### Zoom Shots

36. **Zoom In**: The camera zooms in on the subject, gradually making it appear larger. This can focus attention on a particular detail or create a sense of intensity.

37. **Zoom Out**: The camera zooms out from the subject, gradually revealing more of the scene. This can be used to show the subject’s surroundings or to create a sense of isolation as the subject becomes smaller in the frame.
