# arc42 Cheatsheet

The **arc42** template is a comprehensive framework for documenting software architecture. It focuses on providing a structured approach to capture and communicate architectural decisions, designs, and rationale.

---

## Structure of arc42

### 1. Introduction and Goals
- **Purpose**: Outline the purpose of the architecture documentation.
- **Goals**: Define the primary goals and objectives of the system, including business and technical goals.

### 2. Constraints
- **Definition**: Document constraints that influence the architecture, such as technology, regulations, or performance limits.
- **Examples**:
    - Legal requirements (e.g., data protection laws).
    - Technology stack restrictions (e.g., programming languages, frameworks).

### 3. Context and Scope
- **System Context**: Provide an overview of the system's environment, including external systems and actors.
- **Scope**: Define what is included in the architecture and what is not (in-scope and out-of-scope elements).

### 4. Solution Strategy
- **High-Level Approach**: Describe the overarching strategy for the architecture, including key design principles and patterns.
- **Decisions**: Outline important architectural decisions and their rationale.

### 5. Building Blocks
- **Components**: Identify the main building blocks (components, modules, services) of the system.
- **Interactions**: Describe how these components interact and communicate with each other.

### 6. Runtime View
- **Behavior**: Document the runtime behavior of the system, including key scenarios and workflows.
- **State Changes**: Capture state changes and interactions among components during runtime.

### 7. Deployment View
- **Architecture Deployment**: Illustrate how the architecture is deployed in a physical environment (e.g., servers, cloud services).
- **Infrastructure**: Describe the infrastructure needed to support the architecture.

### 8. Cross-Cutting Concepts
- **Common Concerns**: Identify cross-cutting concerns that impact multiple components or aspects of the system (e.g., security, logging, error handling).
- **Implementation Strategies**: Describe how these concerns are addressed within the architecture.

### 9. Quality Requirements
- **Non-Functional Requirements**: Document quality attributes such as performance, security, scalability, and maintainability.
- **Metrics**: Define how quality requirements will be measured.

### 10. Risks and Technical Debt
- **Risks**: Identify potential risks associated with the architecture and implementation.
- **Technical Debt**: Document areas of the architecture that may incur technical debt and strategies for addressing them.

### 11. Glossary
- **Definitions**: Provide definitions for key terms and acronyms used throughout the documentation.

### 12. References
- **Related Documents**: List relevant documents, diagrams, and resources that provide additional context or details about the architecture.

## Best Practices for Using arc42
- **Iterative Updates**: Continuously update the documentation as the architecture evolves.
- **Visual Diagrams**: Use diagrams to enhance understanding and provide visual context for complex topics.
- **Stakeholder Collaboration**: Engage stakeholders throughout the documentation process to ensure alignment and address concerns.
