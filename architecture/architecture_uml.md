## Structure Diagrams
These diagrams focus on the static structure of the system and its components.

### 1. Class Diagram
- **Purpose**: Describes the structure of the system by showing its classes, attributes, operations, and relationships (associations, generalizations, dependencies).
- **Use When**: You want to model the blueprint of the system, its objects, and their interconnections.

### 2. Object Diagram
- **Purpose**: Represents an instance of a class diagram showing specific object instances and their relationships at a particular point in time.
- **Use When**: You need a snapshot of the system at runtime (e.g., testing or debugging).

### 3. Component Diagram
- **Purpose**: Describes the high-level components (software modules) and their relationships, focusing on interfaces and dependencies between components.
- **Use When**: You want to show the architecture of the system in terms of components.

### 4. Composite Structure Diagram
- **Purpose**: Shows the internal structure of a class, component, or other classifiers, focusing on the internal interactions between parts.
- **Use When**: You need to illustrate the internal workings of a complex system or object.

### 5. Deployment Diagram
- **Purpose**: Models the physical deployment of software artifacts (executables, files, etc.) onto hardware nodes and devices.
- **Use When**: You are working on system architecture and need to model how software will run on physical hardware.

### 6. Package Diagram
- **Purpose**: Organizes elements of a system into related groups (packages) to illustrate the modular structure of the system.
- **Use When**: You need to organize and manage large systems by grouping related classes and components.

### 7. Profile Diagram
- **Purpose**: Allows the customization of UML models for particular domains (e.g., real-time, enterprise systems) by defining profiles, stereotypes, and tagged values.
- **Use When**: You are extending UML to model specific domains with custom constructs.

## Behavior Diagrams
These diagrams focus on the dynamic behavior of the system and interactions between elements over time.

### 1. Use Case Diagram
- **Purpose**: Describes the system's functionality from a user's perspective, showing interactions between users (actors) and system features (use cases).
- **Use When**: You are defining requirements and want to capture high-level user interactions with the system.

### 2. Activity Diagram
- **Purpose**: Models workflows and processes by showing the flow of control between activities (e.g., tasks, operations, or steps).
- **Use When**: You need to describe the logic of a system process, business workflow, or algorithm.

### 3. State Machine Diagram (State Diagram)
- **Purpose**: Depicts the states of an object throughout its lifecycle and the transitions between those states based on events.
- **Use When**: You want to model the behavior of an object that reacts to events, especially in real-time systems.

### 4. Sequence Diagram
- **Purpose**: Illustrates how objects interact in a particular scenario of a use case, focusing on the order of messages exchanged between objects.
- **Use When**: You want to model the flow of messages between objects over time in a specific sequence.

### 5. Communication Diagram
- **Purpose**: Similar to sequence diagrams but emphasizes the structure and relationships between objects, focusing on the network of messages passed.
- **Use When**: You want to focus on object interactions and their relationships rather than the order of events.

### 6. Interaction Overview Diagram
- **Purpose**: Provides an overview of how different interactions (such as sequence diagrams) fit together within a broader process or workflow.
- **Use When**: You need to depict the overall control flow between various interactions in a complex system.

### 7. Timing Diagram
- **Purpose**: Models the behavior of objects over time, focusing on time constraints and how object states change with time.
- **Use When**: Timing is a critical aspect of your system, and you need to ensure that certain actions occur at precise times.

## Interaction Diagrams (Subset of Behavior Diagrams)

1. **Sequence Diagram** (also listed under behavior diagrams)
    - **Purpose**: Focuses on the time-ordered flow of messages.

2. **Communication Diagram** (also listed under behavior diagrams)
    - **Purpose**: Emphasizes object interactions and relationships.

3. **Timing Diagram** (also listed under behavior diagrams)
    - **Purpose**: Focuses on the timing of interactions.

4. **Interaction Overview Diagram** (also listed under behavior diagrams)
    - **Purpose**: High-level control flow between interactions.
