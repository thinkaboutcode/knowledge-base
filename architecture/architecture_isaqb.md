## 1. Context View
- **Purpose**: Shows the software systemâ€™s boundaries and interactions with its environment (external systems, users, or devices).
- **Focus**: High-level overview of external dependencies and interfaces.
- **Typical Stakeholders**: Project managers, product owners, and external system developers.
- **Key Questions Addressed**:
  - What lies within and outside the system?
  - Who or what interacts with the system, and how?

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Uses| B[Web Application]
    B -->|Interacts with| C[Backend Service]
    C -->|Fetches data from| D[Database]
    C -->|Calls| E[External API]
    
    subgraph "External Systems"
        F[Payment Service]
        G[Email Service]
    end

    B -->|Notifies| F
    C -->|Sends emails via| G
```

## 2. Building Blocks View
- **Purpose**: Illustrates the static structure of the system, including its components and their internal organization.
- **Focus**: Modular decomposition, showing how the system is divided into smaller parts (building blocks).
- **Typical Stakeholders**: Developers, architects, and maintainers.
- **Key Questions Addressed**:
  - What are the system's internal components?
  - How are they organized, and what are their responsibilities?
  - How do the components interact internally?

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Frontend] -->|Uses API| B[Backend Service]
    B -->|Fetches data from| C[Database]
    B --> D[Authentication Service]
    B --> E[External API]
    
    subgraph "Frontend"
        A1[UI Component] --> A2[Search Component]
    end

    subgraph "Backend"
        B1[API Controller] --> B2[Business Logic]
        B2 --> B3[Data Access Layer]
    end

    subgraph "Database"
        C1[User Table]
        C2[Product Table]
    end
```

## 3. Runtime View
- **Purpose**: Describes the dynamic behavior of the system during execution.
- **Focus**: Interactions between components at runtime, including process communication, sequences, and data flow.
- **Typical Stakeholders**: Developers, testers, and operations teams.
- **Key Questions Addressed**:
  - How do components interact dynamically during execution?
  - What happens in specific use cases or scenarios?

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant WebApp
    participant BackendService
    participant Database

    User->>WebApp: Request data (e.g., search query)
    WebApp->>BackendService: API call with query
    BackendService->>Database: Fetch data from database
    Database-->>BackendService: Return data
    BackendService-->>WebApp: Return response
    WebApp-->>User: Display results
```

---

## 4. Deployment View
- **Purpose**: Maps the software system to physical hardware infrastructure.
- **Focus**: Allocation of software components to physical nodes and their connections (e.g., servers, networks).
- **Typical Stakeholders**: DevOps, system administrators, and IT infrastructure teams.
- **Key Questions Addressed**:
  - Where does the software run?
  - How are hardware resources utilized?
  - How does the system ensure scalability, availability, and fault tolerance?

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Server 1"
        A[Web Application] 
        A1[Frontend UI]
        A2[API Server]
    end

    subgraph "Server 2"
        B[Backend Service]
        B1[Application Logic]
        B2[API Controller]
    end

    subgraph "Database Server"
        C[Database]
        C1[User Table]
        C2[Product Table]
    end

    subgraph "External Service"
        D[Third-Party API]
    end

    A2 --> B2
    B2 --> C
    B1 --> D

    A1 -.->|User Requests| A2
```

## Summary
These views are specifically designed to address the concerns of different stakeholders and provide a clear, practical way to understand the architecture of a software system. They are tailored for the CPSA-F curriculum and differ slightly from the classic **4+1 View Model** by focusing on stakeholder-specific needs.
