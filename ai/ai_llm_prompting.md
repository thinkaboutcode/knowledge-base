| **Zero-Shot Prompting**             | The model is asked to perform a task without any examples or prior context. It's based entirely on the instruction given. | Simple tasks, general queries, straightforward requests.                                               | "Translate the following English sentence to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"                                                                                      |
| **Few-Shot Prompting**              | The model is provided with a few examples of the task to guide its response.                                            | More complex tasks where context is important, such as text classification, creative tasks, or style imitation. | "Translate the following sentences from English to French:  <br> 1. 'Hello, how are you?' -> 'Bonjour, comment ça va?'  <br> 2. 'What is your name?' -> 'Comment vous appelez-vous?'  <br> Now translate: 'Where is the nearest station?'" |
| **Chain-of-Thought Prompting**      | The model is encouraged to break down its reasoning into steps to solve a problem.                                      | Logical reasoning, math problems, complex decision-making tasks.                                        | "If John has 10 apples and gives 3 to Mary, how many apples does John have left? <br> Let's break this down:  <br> 1. John starts with 10 apples.  <br> 2. He gives 3 to Mary.  <br> 3. Subtract 3 from 10.  <br> John has 7 apples left." |
| **Role-Playing or Persona Prompting** | The model adopts a specific role or persona to perform a task.                                                           | Customer support simulations, interviews, storytelling, educational contexts.                           | "You are a tech support agent. A customer is complaining that their internet is not working. How do you respond?"                                                  |
| **Instructional Prompting**         | The model is given clear, explicit instructions to perform a specific task.                                              | Direct tasks where precision is crucial, such as data extraction, formatting, or coding.                | "List all the items in the following text: 'Apples, Oranges, Bananas, and Grapes'."                                                                               |
| **Conversational Prompting**        | The model is engaged in a back-and-forth interaction, mimicking a human conversation.                                    | Dialogue systems, chatbots, interactive storytelling, tutoring.                                         | "User: What is the weather like today? <br> Model: The weather today is sunny with a high of 25°C."                                                                     |
| **Contextual Prompting**            | The model is provided with context or background information before asking it to perform a task.                         | Tasks requiring understanding of prior information, like summarization, answering specific questions, or content generation. | "Here is a news article about climate change. Summarize the main points: [Insert article text]"                                                                   |
| **Iterative Prompting**             | The model is asked to refine or improve upon its previous outputs iteratively.                                           | Creative writing, code optimization, debugging, improving drafts.                                        | "Generate a title for this article: [Text]. <br> Now make it more engaging."                                                                                           |
| **Multi-turn Prompting**            | The model is engaged in a multi-step process, where each step builds on the previous one.                                 | Problem-solving, complex workflows, multi-step instructions.                                            | "Step 1: Identify the main idea of this paragraph. <br> Step 2: Provide a summary in one sentence. <br> Step 3: Suggest a title based on the summary."                      |
| **Self-Consistency Prompting**      | The model is asked to provide multiple answers or solutions to a problem, and the most consistent or common response is chosen. | Ensuring accuracy, improving reliability in complex reasoning tasks.                                     | "Calculate the following equation using two different methods: (3 + 5) * 2. <br> What is the answer?"                                                                  |
| **Critique and Refinement Prompting** | The model is asked to critique or refine a response, either its own or another’s, and then provide an improved version.   | Improving content quality, feedback loops, collaborative tasks.                                         | "Here’s a paragraph about space exploration. <br> What could be improved in this text? <br> Now, rewrite it with those improvements."                                        |
| **Contrastive Prompting**           | The model is asked to compare and contrast different inputs or scenarios.                                                | Decision making, comparative analysis, opinion generation.                                              | "Compare the themes of freedom and security in the following two quotes: <br> [Quote 1] <br> [Quote 2]."                                                                |
| **Visual Prompting** *(For multimodal models)* | The model is provided with an image (or a description of it) and asked to perform a task related to the image.          | Image captioning, visual question answering, content creation.                                          | "Describe what is happening in this image: [Image description]."                                                                                                  |
| **In-context Learning**             | The model learns from examples provided in the prompt itself without explicit training on new data.                      | Tasks where learning from provided examples can lead to more accurate results.                           | "Translate the following sentences from English to Spanish:  <br> 'I am hungry.' -> 'Tengo hambre.'  <br> Now translate: 'I am tired.'"                                       |
| **Collaborative Prompting**         | The model is asked to generate content in a collaborative manner, potentially with inputs or corrections from the user.  | Co-writing, brainstorming, interactive content generation.                                              | "Let’s write a short story together. <br> I’ll start: 'Once upon a time in a faraway land…'  <br> Now you continue the story."                                               |
