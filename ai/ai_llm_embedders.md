# Comparison of Document Embedders

## What is an Embedder?
An embedder is a model or algorithm used to convert text data into numerical vectors (embeddings) that capture the semantic meaning and contextual relationships of the text. These embeddings allow for easier comparison, retrieval, and processing of text in various applications, such as natural language processing (NLP), machine learning, and information retrieval. By representing text in a continuous vector space, embedders facilitate tasks like semantic search, clustering, classification, and more.

    - Strong contextual embeddings capturing language nuances.
    - Highly customizable for specific tasks.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Fine-grained tasks like sentiment analysis or named entity recognition.
    - Deep context understanding needed.

## 6. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- **Type**: Statistical
- **Strengths**:
    - Simple and interpretable.
    - Fast to compute.
- **Use Cases**:
    - Traditional information retrieval tasks emphasizing interpretability.
    - Quick baseline embeddings when resources are limited.
