3. **AI Deployment & MLOps**
    - Learn about deploying ML models in production environments.
    - Understand the CI/CD pipeline, Docker, Kubernetes.
    - Resources: Coursera (MLOps Fundamentals), books like *“Building Machine Learning Powered Applications”*.

4. **Microservices & Distributed Systems**
    - Learn how large-scale AI systems work, involving microservices architecture and distributed computing.
    - Tools: Kafka, RabbitMQ for messaging, REST APIs for service communication.

## Phase 4: Specialization and Architecture (6-12 months)
**Goal**: Become proficient in architecting AI solutions end-to-end.

1. **AI Architect Design Principles**
    - Learn the architecture design patterns for building scalable, fault-tolerant, and distributed AI systems.
    - Resources: AWS Well-Architected Framework, *“Designing Data-Intensive Applications”* by Martin Kleppmann.

2. **Enterprise AI Solutions**
    - Design AI solutions for real-world enterprise problems, considering aspects like cost, performance, scalability, and security.

3. **Optimization and Fine-Tuning Models**
