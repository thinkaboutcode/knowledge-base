            case Double d -> 
                System.out.println("It's a Double with value: " + d);
            case int[] arr -> 
                System.out.println("It's an int array with length: " + arr.length);
            case null -> 
                System.out.println("It's null!");
            default -> 
                System.out.println("Unknown type: " + obj);
        }
    }
}
```

### Record Pattern in Java

The **record pattern** is a feature introduced in **Java 21** as part of the Project Amber initiative. It enhances pattern matching by allowing developers to match and destructure **record types**. Records, introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and finalized in Java 16, are a special kind of class in Java designed to be simple data carriers, automatically generating methods like `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()`.

#### Key Concepts of Record Pattern

#### 1. Simplified Syntax for Matching Records
- A **record** in Java is a class that holds a fixed set of fields. With the **record pattern**, Java enables you to destructure those fields easily within the context of **pattern matching**.
- It simplifies code that traditionally uses **`instanceof`** and **type casting** to work with the fields of a record.

#### 2. Pattern Matching for Record Classes
- The **record pattern** allows you to match records and extract their components directly in the pattern.
- This feature eliminates the need for manually accessing the fields of the record.

#### Benefits of Record Pattern

- **Concise Code**: The record pattern allows you to match records and extract their components directly, removing the need for getter methods or field access.
- **Improved Readability**: The ability to destructure records directly in the pattern improves code clarity, especially when working with record classes.
- **Type Safety**: The pattern matching process ensures type safety, ensuring that only the correct type is matched and destructured.

#### Summary

- Introduced in **Java 21**.
- Simplifies working with **record types** by allowing for direct matching and extraction of fields.
- Reduces boilerplate code and enhances readability and type safety.

This feature is part of a broader set of improvements in pattern matching in Java, including **instanceof**, **switch expressions**, and other advanced matching capabilities.

```java
public record Person(String name, int age) {}

public class RecordPatternExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    Person person1 = new Person("Alice", 30);
    Person person2 = new Person("Bob", 25);

    // Using a switch with record patterns
    printPersonInfo(person1);
    printPersonInfo(person2);
  }

  public static void printPersonInfo(Object obj) {
    switch (obj) {
      case Person(String name, int age) ->
              System.out.println(name + " is " + age + " years old.");
      default ->
              System.out.println("Not a person.");
    }
  }
}
```

#### Virtual Threads
[Check this for more info](code_java_virtual_threads_cheatsheet.md) 

#### Sequenced Collections

Sequenced collections provide a more consistent way to handle collections that have an order, such as `List`, `Deque`, and `Set`. They allow you to access both the sequence (order of elements) and provide a consistent interface for operations like accessing elements by their index or iterating through the collection.

In particular, sequenced collections introduce a new interface called `Sequenced` with methods like `first()`, `last()`, and `next()`, which can be used to access the first and last elements of a collection, among other things.

#### Key Points:
- **`List`** and **`Deque`** are examples of sequenced collections in Java 20.
- **`first()`**: Returns the first element in the collection.
- **`last()`**: Returns the last element in the collection.
- **`forEach()`**: Standard method to iterate over all elements.

#### Benefits of Sequenced Collections:
1. **Consistency**: Provides consistent methods like `first()` and `last()` for accessing elements, regardless of the collection type.
2. **Simplification**: Reduces the need to write custom code for common operations on ordered collections.
3. **Extensibility**: Can be used with any collection that maintains an order (e.g., `List`, `Deque`, `Set`).

Sequenced collections streamline handling ordered collections by providing a unified API for sequence-related operations.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SequencedCollectionExample {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Create a List (Sequenced collection)
    List<String> fruits = List.of("Apple", "Banana", "Cherry", "Date");

    // Accessing the first and last elements using sequenced collection methods
    System.out.println("First fruit: " + fruits.first());
    System.out.println("Last fruit: " + fruits.last());

    // Iterating through the sequenced collection
    System.out.println("All fruits:");
    fruits.forEach(System.out::println);

    // Create a Deque (also a Sequenced collection)
    Deque<String> vegetables = new ArrayDeque<>(List.of("Carrot", "Broccoli", "Spinach"));

    // Accessing the first and last elements of the Deque
    System.out.println("First vegetable: " + vegetables.first());
    System.out.println("Last vegetable: " + vegetables.last());

    // Adding and removing from the Deque
    vegetables.addFirst("Cucumber");
    vegetables.addLast("Potato");
    System.out.println("Updated vegetables:");
    vegetables.forEach(System.out::println);
  }
}

    // Common properties or methods for all shapes
    public abstract double area();
}

// File: Circle.java
public final class Circle extends Shape {
    private final double radius;

    public Circle(double radius) {
        this.radius = radius;
    }

    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return width * height;
    }
}

        this.height = height;
    }

    @Override
    public double area() {
        return 0.5 * base * height;
    }

```java
public class InstanceOfPatternMatchingExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Object obj = "Hello, Pattern Matching!";

        // Traditional instanceof with explicit casting
        if (obj instanceof String) {
            String str = (String) obj; // Explicit casting
            System.out.println("String length: " + str.length());
        }

        // Modern instanceof with pattern matching
        if (obj instanceof String str) { // Pattern matching
            System.out.println("String length: " + str.length());
        }

        // Another example with different types
        printObjectDetails(42);          // Integer
        printObjectDetails(3.14);        // Double
        printObjectDetails("Pattern!");  // String
    }

    public static void printObjectDetails(Object obj) {
        if (obj instanceof Integer i) {
            System.out.println("Integer value: " + i);
        } else if (obj instanceof Double d) {
            System.out.println("Double value: " + d);
        } else if (obj instanceof String s) {
            System.out.println("String value: " + s);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Unknown type: " + obj);
        }
    }
}
```

### Effect of "Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals" on Existing Code

The feature **"Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals"**, introduced in **Java 16** and refined in later versions, has significant implications for existing code, especially those relying on internal JDK APIs. Below is an overview of the effect this change has on legacy and current applications:

#### 1. Inaccessibility of Internal JDK APIs
- **By default, internal JDK APIs** (e.g., classes and methods under `sun.*`, `com.sun.*`, or `jdk.*`) are **no longer accessible** unless explicitly allowed via command-line flags or module configurations.
- Previously, these internal APIs were available for tasks like performance optimization, working around limitations, or leveraging undocumented functionality.
- **Result**: Any code that uses these internal APIs will break or fail to compile since they are no longer part of the public API.

#### 2. Impact on Existing Code
- **Compilation Failures**: Code that imports or uses internal JDK classes will result in **compilation errors** if the modules or packages are not explicitly opened.
- **Runtime Failures**: Even if code compiles (e.g., through reflective access or command-line flags), attempting to access these APIs will result in **runtime errors**, such as `IllegalAccessException`, unless the program is configured to allow access using JVM flags.
- **Reflection-Based Code**: Many frameworks (e.g., Hibernate, Spring, and application servers) and tools may use reflection to access JDK internals. This type of code may break due to **strong encapsulation**, requiring updates to the framework or additional configurations to re-enable access.

#### 3. JVM Flags and Workarounds
- **Command-Line Flags**: Developers can still access these internal APIs by using JVM flags like `--add-opens` or `--add-exports`. For example:
    - `--add-opens java.base/sun.nio.ch=ALL-UNNAMED` to allow access to internal classes in the `sun.nio.ch` package.
    - `--add-exports java.base/com.sun.nio.sctp=ALL-UNNAMED` to export internal JDK packages to unnamed modules.
- **Note**: This workaround **is not recommended for production**, as it negates some of the security and modularity benefits of strong encapsulation.

#### 4. Security and Maintenance Benefits
- **Improved Security**: Strong encapsulation limits the attack surface by preventing access to internal and potentially insecure or outdated JDK classes.
- **Stability and Maintainability**: By hiding internal APIs, future JDK releases can change the implementation of these APIs without breaking public-facing code. This leads to **better stability** across Java versions.
- **Encourages Best Practices**: It encourages developers to use officially supported, public APIs or libraries that are not reliant on undocumented or unsupported internal features.

#### 5. What Can Developers Do?
- **Update Dependencies**: If your application relies on internal JDK APIs, you need to either update the affected code or migrate to official Java APIs or third-party libraries that do not depend on JDK internals.
- **Use Public APIs**: Developers are encouraged to migrate their code to **official, supported Java APIs** or leverage newer solutions available in Java.

#### 6. Example Use Cases Affected
- **Reflection Access**: If your code uses reflection to access JDK internals, this will no longer work unless granted access via JVM flags.
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Some third-party libraries or frameworks that relied on internal JDK APIs (e.g., `sun.misc.Unsafe`) may break unless updated to avoid reliance on these internals.
- **Custom JVM Optimizations**: If your application directly interfaces with JVM internals for optimizations (e.g., garbage collection tuning or memory buffers), this will require changes.

#### Summary
**Strong Encapsulation of JDK Internals** improves Java’s security and maintainability but introduces challenges for codebases dependent on internal JDK APIs. To maintain compatibility with newer Java versions:

- **Refactor or replace** reliance on internal JDK APIs.
- Use **official APIs** or migrate to third-party libraries that do not depend on JDK internals.
- If necessary, use JVM flags temporarily for compatibility, but this is not recommended for production environments due to security risks.

This change encourages developers to move towards **modular and secure approaches**, adhering to public, supported Java APIs.


## Java 16 (March 2021)
- **JEP 376: ZGC on macOS**: Adds support for ZGC (Z Garbage Collector) on macOS for low-latency garbage collection.
- **JEP 395: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals**: Ensures internal JDK APIs are fully encapsulated, increasing security.
- **JEP 396: Strongly Encapsulate JDK Internals**: Further improvements to encapsulation of internal JDK APIs.

### Java Records
```java
public record Person(String name, int age) { }
```

This record is automatically equipped with:

- **A constructor** that takes `name` and `age` as parameters.
- **Getters** for `name` and `age`.
- **`toString()`**, **`equals()`**, and **`hashCode()`** methods.

### Java Records vs. Lombok

Java's **records**, introduced in **Java 16**, share some functionality with the **Lombok** library, especially for creating data classes. Lombok has been popular for reducing boilerplate in Java with annotations, but records bring an alternative with differences in design and scope. Here’s a comparison:

#### Similarities Between Records and Lombok

- **Boilerplate Reduction**: Both records and Lombok reduce repetitive code in Java by eliminating the need to manually write getters, `equals()`, `hashCode()`, and `toString()` methods.
- **Immutability Support**: Records are inherently immutable, and Lombok can create immutable classes with annotations like `@Value`.
- **Data-Oriented Classes**: Both are used primarily for classes that act as **data holders** rather than objects with complex behavior.

#### Key Differences Between Records and Lombok

#### 1. Built-In vs. External Library
- **Records** are a core part of Java starting from **Java 16**, with no external dependencies required.
- **Lombok** is a third-party library, which requires adding a dependency and may have compatibility issues across IDEs and Java versions.

#### 2. Immutable by Default vs. Configurable Immutability
- **Records** enforce immutability by design: fields are `final` and cannot change after construction.
- **Lombok** allows both **mutable** and **immutable** classes. With annotations like `@Data`, Lombok can generate setters for mutable fields, while `@Value` makes immutable classes.

#### 3. Customization of Fields and Methods
- **Lombok** provides greater flexibility with features like:
  - `@Builder` for complex object construction.
  - `@ToString`, `@EqualsAndHashCode`, and `@Getter/@Setter` for fine-tuned control over specific methods.
  - Optional parameters, validation, and default values using `@Builder.Default`.
- **Records** have more limitations. The primary constructor and `toString`, `equals`, and `hashCode` methods are automatically generated and cannot be customized with additional annotations. However, other methods can be added, and **compact constructors** allow data validation or transformation on creation.

#### 4. Subclassing and Finality
- **Records** are implicitly `final` and cannot be subclassed, which supports immutability and predictability.
- **Lombok** classes are not necessarily `final` and can be subclassed, which is useful when inheritance is required.

#### 5. Compatibility and Ecosystem
- **Records**, being a core language feature, are fully supported across Java tooling, IDEs, and frameworks.
- **Lombok** support varies by IDE and build tool, though it has improved over the years.

#### When to Use Records vs. Lombok

- **Use Records** when:
  - You want a **concise, immutable data class** without external dependencies.
  - You’re working on a project where **immutability** is essential and using Java 16 or newer.
  - You don’t need the additional customization features that Lombok offers.

- **Use Lombok** when:
  - You need **customization** beyond what records provide, such as mutable fields, builder patterns, or optional methods like setters.
  - You’re working with a codebase that already uses Lombok or needs to support a **Java version older than Java 16**.
  - You need finer control over specific methods or fields.

#### Summary

Java **records** offer a built-in solution for creating immutable data classes in Java but lack the advanced features and flexibility provided by **Lombok**. For developers who need simplicity and immutability and are on Java 16+, records are a powerful tool. However, for projects requiring more customization or backward compatibility, **Lombok** remains a valuable alternative.


## Java 15 (September 2020)
- **Sealed Classes (Preview)**: Introduces sealed classes to restrict the inheritance of classes.
- **Hidden Classes**: Supports hidden classes that can be used by frameworks for better runtime performance.
- **ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)**: Experimental low-latency garbage collector to handle large heaps efficiently.


## Java 14 (March 2020)
- **JEP 358: Helpful NullPointerException**: Improves `NullPointerException` messages by providing more context about the error.
- **JEP 359: Records (Preview)**: Introduces records, a new kind of type to model immutable data.
- **JEP 370: Foreign-Memory Access API (Incubator)**: Introduces a new API for safely accessing memory outside of the Java heap.

### Helpful NullPointerException (Java 14)

Introduced in **Java 14**, the **Helpful NullPointerException** provides more detailed information when a `NullPointerException` occurs. It helps developers quickly identify which variable or expression caused the `null` dereference, making debugging easier and faster.

#### Key Features:
- **Detailed Error Messages**: The exception message includes the name of the variable or expression that was `null`.
- **Improved Debugging**: Instead of just saying `NullPointerException`, it specifies which object or method was null, providing context to locate the issue quickly.
- **Enabled by Default**: This feature is enabled by default in Java 14 and later.
- **Can Be Disabled**: It can be turned off with the JVM flag `-XX:-ShowCodeDetailsInExceptionMessages`.

#### Benefits:
- **Faster Debugging**: Developers can easily spot which variable caused the exception.
- **Better Developer Experience**: Makes stack traces more informative and reduces debugging time.

In summary, **Helpful NullPointerException** in Java 14 enhances error messages to make `NullPointerExceptions` easier to debug by showing exactly which part of the code was `null`.


## Java 13 (September 2019)
- **JEP 355: Text Blocks**: Introduces text blocks for multi-line string literals, improving readability and reducing escape sequences.
- **JEP 351: ZGC (Z Garbage Collector)**: Improved ZGC for better performance and scalability.
- **JEP 350: Dynamic CDS Archives**: Introduces a dynamic class-data-sharing feature to improve startup performance.

### Text Blocks for Multi-Line String Literals (Java 13+)

Introduced in **Java 13** as a **preview feature** and made permanent in **Java 15**, **text blocks** provide an easier and more readable way to work with **multi-line string literals**. They eliminate the need for cumbersome concatenation and escape sequences, making the code cleaner and more readable.

#### Key Features of Text Blocks:
- **Multi-line Strings**: Text blocks allow you to define strings that span multiple lines without the need for explicit line breaks or concatenation.
- **Automatic Formatting**: Whitespace and line breaks are preserved as part of the string, making the code more intuitive.
- **Escape Sequences**: You no longer need to escape special characters like newline `\n`, tab `\t`, or quotes `\"` within the text block.
- **Consistent Indentation**: The text block automatically strips out unnecessary leading indentation, making the code look well-structured.

#### Syntax:
Text blocks are enclosed in triple quotes (`"""`), and the string content inside can span multiple lines.

#### Example:
```java
String json = """
               {
                 "name": "John",
                 "age": 30,
                 "city": "New York"
               }
               """;
```

### Dynamic CDS

**Dynamic CDS (Class Data Sharing) Archives** were introduced to enhance startup time and reduce memory footprint by allowing the JVM to share class data across multiple Java processes. Instead of pre-generating class metadata during JDK build or application packaging, Dynamic CDS Archives are created at runtime, providing more flexibility.

#### Key Steps for Using Dynamic CDS Archives:
1. **Generate the CDS Archive**:
   You generate the dynamic CDS archive by running a Java application with the `-Xshare:dump` option. This step collects the class data for classes that are loaded during the execution of the application.

2. **Run the Application with the CDS Archive**:
   Once the archive is generated, you run your Java application with the `-Xshare:auto` or `-Xshare:on` option. This instructs the JVM to use the generated CDS archive, which can improve startup time and reduce memory usage by loading the shared class data from the archive.

3. **Verify the CDS Archive**:
   You can verify that the CDS archive is being used by checking the JVM startup logs or using the `-verbose:class` option, which will show which classes are being loaded and whether they are loaded from the CDS archive.

#### Benefits of Dynamic CDS Archives:
- **Faster Startup Time**: By reusing class data, the JVM can start applications more quickly.
- **Reduced Memory Footprint**: Multiple JVM processes can share the same class data, reducing overall memory usage.
- **Dynamic Class Loading**: The archive is created based on the classes that are actually used at runtime, offering flexibility compared to static archives.

#### Conclusion:
Dynamic CDS Archives in Java 12 provide a mechanism to improve the performance of Java applications by sharing class metadata at runtime, leading to faster startup and reduced memory consumption.


## Java 12 (March 2019)
- **JEP 189: Shenandoah GC (Garbage Collector)**: Experimental low-latency garbage collector that reduces GC pause times.
- **JEP 230: Microbenchmarking Support**: Improves the JVM's capabilities for benchmarking code reliably.
- **JEP 325: Switch Expressions (Standard)**: Switch expressions were officially made a standard feature, enhancing the expressiveness and usability of the switch statement.

### Switch Expressions

### Key Features of Switch Expressions:
- **Return Values**: You can now return a value from a `switch` expression.
- **Arrow (`->`) Syntax**: The new syntax uses the `->` arrow instead of the `:` colon.
- **Multiple Labels**: Multiple labels can be grouped together to avoid code repetition.
- **`yield` Statement**: When returning a value, use the `yield` keyword.

```java
public class SwitchExpressionExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String day = "Monday";
        
        // Using switch expression to get the type of day
        String result = switch (day) {
            case "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday" -> "Weekday";
            case "Saturday", "Sunday" -> "Weekend";
            default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day: " + day);
        };
        
        System.out.println(result);  // Outputs: Weekday
    }
}

public class SwitchExpressionWithYield {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    int dayOfWeek = 3; // Let's assume 1=Sunday, 2=Monday, ..., 7=Saturday

    // Using switch expression with yield
    String result = switch (dayOfWeek) {
      case 1 -> {
        System.out.println("It's Sunday!");
        yield "Weekend";
      }
      case 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 -> {
        System.out.println("It's a weekday!");
        yield "Weekday";
      }
      case 7 -> {
        System.out.println("It's Saturday!");
        yield "Weekend";
      }
      default -> throw new IllegalArgumentException("Invalid day number: " + dayOfWeek);
    };

    System.out.println(result);  // Output: "It's a weekday!" followed by "Weekday"
  }
}


```

## Java 11 (September 2018 - LTS)
- **Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters**: Adds the ability to use `var` in lambda parameters.
- **Epsilon Garbage Collector**: A no-op garbage collector designed for performance testing.
- **JEP 321: HTTP Client**: Introduces a new standard HTTP client for making HTTP requests with better performance and features.

### Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters

**Local-Variable Syntax for Lambda Parameters** allows you to use **`var`** for lambda parameters. This feature simplifies the lambda syntax by enabling the automatic inference of the parameter type, eliminating the need for explicit type declarations.

### Benefits:
- **Simplified Syntax**: Using `var` reduces the amount of boilerplate code, especially when the type is obvious or easily inferred.
- **Consistency**: It provides a more consistent syntax by aligning with the `var` keyword used for local variables, making the code cleaner and more uniform.

### Conclusion:
Local-variable syntax for lambda parameters, introduced in Java 11, enables the use of `var` in lambda expressions, which simplifies the syntax, making the code more concise while maintaining type safety.


```java
import java.util.List;

public class LocalVariableSyntaxForLambdaParameters {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> names = List.of("Alice", "Bob", "Charlie");

        // Lambda expression with explicit types
        names.forEach((String name) -> {
            System.out.println(name);
        });

        // Lambda expression with var (local-variable syntax)
        names.forEach((var name) -> {
            System.out.println(name);
        });
    }
}
```

## Java 10 (March 2018)
- **Local-Variable Type Inference**: Introduces the `var` keyword to allow local variable type inference.
- **G1 Garbage Collector Improvements**: Improves the performance of the G1 garbage collector.
- **JEP 286: Switch Expressions (Preview)**: Introduces switch expressions to enhance the switch statement with more flexibility and conciseness.

### Local-Variable Type Inference

This feature allows the compiler to automatically infer the type of a local variable based on the value assigned to it, eliminating the need for explicit type declarations.

### Important Notes:
- **Initialization Required**: A variable declared with `var` must be initialized at the time of declaration. The type is inferred from this initialization.
- **Cannot Be Used for Fields, Method Parameters, or Return Types**: The `var` keyword can only be used for local variables within methods. It cannot be used for fields, method parameters, or return types.
- **Type Safety**: The type inferred is fixed, ensuring that type safety is maintained throughout the program.

### Benefits:
- **Reduced Boilerplate**: It eliminates the need for repeated type declarations, making the code more concise and cleaner.
- **Enhanced Readability**: The focus is shifted from types to logic, improving the overall readability of the code.
- **Increased Flexibility**: Especially useful when the type is obvious from the context, such as with complex generics or when working with collections.

### Conclusion:
Local-variable type inference, introduced in Java 10, simplifies variable declarations using the `var` keyword. This reduces verbosity and improves readability while ensuring type safety.


```java
String message = "Hello, World!";
int number = 42;

var message = "Hello, World!";  // Compiler infers the type as String
var number = 42;                // Compiler infers the type as int

```

## Java 9 (September 2017)
- **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)**: Introduces the module system to allow for better modularization of the Java platform.
- **JEP 201: Modular JDK**: Modifies the JDK itself to be modular, enabling developers to use only the parts of the JDK they need.
- **JShell**: A Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) introduced for experimenting with Java code interactively.

### Java Platform Module System

**Java Platform Module System (JPMS)** was introduced in **Java 9** to provide a way to modularize Java applications, allowing developers to break down large applications into smaller, more manageable modules. This system enhances maintainability, security, and dependency management within Java applications.

#### Key Features of JPMS:
- **Modularization**: Allows you to divide a program into distinct modules, each with specific responsibilities.
- **Encapsulation**: Modules control which classes and packages are accessible to other modules, keeping internal details private.
- **Dependencies**: Modules can explicitly specify their dependencies on other modules, making the relationships between them clear.

#### How JPMS Works:
1. **Define a Module**: A module is defined using the `module-info.java` file, which is located at the root of the module’s source directory. This file specifies the module's name, its dependencies on other modules, and which packages are exported for use by other modules.

2. **Create Classes in the Module**: Java classes are placed within the module and can be accessed by other modules if they are exported through the `module-info.java` file.

3. **Dependencies Between Modules**: If one module depends on another, the dependent module will specify this relationship in its own `module-info.java` file using the `requires` keyword. This makes it clear which modules are required for the application to function.

4. **Compiling and Running Modules**: Modules are compiled with `javac` and run with `java`, specifying the module path to indicate where the modules are located.

#### Benefits of JPMS:
- **Improved Modularity**: Break down large applications into smaller, well-defined modules, making it easier to manage dependencies and maintain the application.
- **Strong Encapsulation**: By explicitly defining what is exported and what is internal, you can better control the visibility of classes and packages, improving security and reducing the risk of accidental misuse.
- **Better Dependency Management**: Modules provide clear relationships between different parts of an application, making the application's structure more transparent and easier to navigate.

#### Conclusion:
The **Java Platform Module System (JPMS)**, introduced in Java 9, allows developers to modularize applications, improving the structure and organization of large codebases. By defining modules using the `module-info.java` file, Java applications can have better encapsulation, clearer dependencies, and improved maintainability.

**Define a first module**
```java
// module-info.java
module com.example.helloworld {
  exports com.example.helloworld;
  requires java.base; // Java base module is implicitly required, but this is explicit
}
```
```java
package com.example.helloworld;

public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java Modules!");
    }
}
```

**Create a second module**
```java
// module-info.java
module com.example.application {
  requires com.example.helloworld;
}
```
Create a Class that uses the first module
```java
package com.example.application;

import com.example.helloworld.HelloWorld;

public class Application {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HelloWorld.main(args); // Accessing the HelloWorld class from the other module
    }
}
```
