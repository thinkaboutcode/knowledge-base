# Building a Simple Knowledge Graph: Film Industry Example

This guide walks through the steps to create a basic knowledge graph focused on the film industry. The example includes key entities like movies, actors, directors, and production companies, with relationships illustrating how these entities are connected.

---

## Step 1: Define the Scope and Entities
1. **Choose the Domain**: We’ll focus on the **Film Industry**.
2. **Identify Key Entities**: In this example, we’ll define the following entities:
    - **People**: Actors, Directors
    - **Movies**: Individual movie titles
    - **Companies**: Studios or streaming platforms

3. **Define Relationships**: Establish how entities relate to each other. Common relationships might include:
    - **"Acted In"**: Connects Actors to Movies
    - **"Directed"**: Connects Directors to Movies
    - **"Produced By"**: Connects Movies to Studios

## Step 2: Gather Data
You can collect data from databases, spreadsheets, or by scraping sources like IMDb or Wikipedia. Here’s a sample dataset:

| Person            | Role       | Movie           | Company     |
|-------------------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Tom Hanks         | Actor      | Forrest Gump    | Paramount   |
| Robert Zemeckis   | Director   | Forrest Gump    | Paramount   |
| Steven Spielberg  | Director   | Jurassic Park   | Universal   |
| Sam Neill         | Actor      | Jurassic Park   | Universal   |

---

## Step 3: Create the Graph Structure
Using a Python library like `NetworkX` or a graph database like Neo4j, we’ll create entities as nodes and relationships as edges.

Here’s an example in Python using `NetworkX`:

```python
import networkx as nx
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Create an empty directed graph
G = nx.DiGraph()

# Add entities (nodes) with labels
G.add_node("Tom Hanks", type="Person")
G.add_node("Robert Zemeckis", type="Person")
G.add_node("Forrest Gump", type="Movie")
G.add_node("Paramount", type="Company")

# Add relationships (edges) between nodes
G.add_edge("Tom Hanks", "Forrest Gump", relation="Acted In")
G.add_edge("Robert Zemeckis", "Forrest Gump", relation="Directed")
G.add_edge("Forrest Gump", "Paramount", relation="Produced By")

# Draw the graph
pos = nx.spring_layout(G)  # Layout for better visualization
nx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=3000, node_color="lightblue", font_size=10, font_weight="bold")
edge_labels = nx.get_edge_attributes(G, 'relation')
nx.draw_networkx_edge_labels(G, pos, edge_labels=edge_labels, font_color="red")
plt.show()
````

# Knowledge Graph vs. SQL Database

Using a knowledge graph instead of a traditional SQL database offers several advantages, especially when dealing with complex, interconnected data. Here’s a breakdown of the benefits and considerations.

---

## 1. Relationship-Centric Structure
- **Knowledge Graph**: Optimized for handling complex relationships, allowing you to query connections like "who acted with whom" or "which company produced films with a specific director" easily.
- **SQL Database**: Requires multiple tables and complex `JOIN` operations to model relationships, which can become slow and hard to manage as data relationships grow.

## 2. Flexibility in Schema
- **Knowledge Graph**: Often schema-less or schema-flexible, making it easy to add new types of relationships or attributes without altering a rigid schema.
- **SQL Database**: Relies on a fixed schema, which can make frequent schema changes costly in terms of time and performance.

## 3. Efficient Traversal and Querying
- **Knowledge Graph**: Highly optimized for traversing and querying relationships. Graph databases use specific traversal algorithms to make querying multi-step connections very efficient.
- **SQL Database**: Multi-layered queries require complex nested queries or recursive `JOIN`s, which can be slow and cumbersome.

## 4. Handling of Heterogeneous Data
- **Knowledge Graph**: Can easily represent entities with varying attributes and relationships, avoiding NULL fields or extensive normalization.
- **SQL Database**: Requires strict table definitions, often leading to NULL fields or multiple tables, which complicate queries and reduce efficiency.

## 5. Semantic Queries
- **Knowledge Graph**: Supports semantic queries with contextual inference, allowing for answers beyond direct relationships.
- **SQL Database**: Designed for structured data rather than semantic relationships, making inference more challenging without additional processing layers.

## 6. Scalability for Certain Use Cases
- **Knowledge Graph**: Scales well for relationship-focused scenarios, handling large networks of interconnected entities.
- **SQL Database**: Optimized for row-based storage and transactional processing, better suited for structured data but less efficient with numerous interrelationships.

## 7. Real-World Modeling Suitability
- **Knowledge Graph**: Naturally fits applications like recommendation engines, fraud detection, social network analysis, and knowledge discovery where connections are key.
- **SQL Database**: Represents connections but isn’t as naturally suited for relationship-heavy use cases, especially with rapidly growing connections.

---

## Example Scenario: Recommendation Systems
Imagine a movie recommendation system:
- **Knowledge Graph**: Easily traverses relationships to find "Movies watched by users who liked the same movies as this user," or "Movies directed by directors frequently collaborating with a specific actor." These recommendations are efficiently queried.
- **SQL Database**: Implementing such recommendations requires extensive `JOIN`s and possibly recursive queries, which can be resource-intensive and slow, especially at scale.

## When to Use Knowledge Graphs vs. SQL Databases

- **Use a Knowledge Graph** if your application focuses on relationships, flexibility, and fast traversal (e.g., social networks, recommendation systems, and knowledge discovery).
- **Use a SQL Database** if you have structured, tabular data with less emphasis on complex interconnections (e.g., traditional transaction processing, financial records, and structured reports).

> **Note**: Hybrid architectures combining both can be a powerful approach, utilizing the strengths of each database type.


# Knowledge Graph vs. Vector Database

When deciding between a knowledge graph and a vector database, it’s essential to understand their differences in structure, purpose, and optimal use cases. Vector databases, often used in machine learning and NLP applications, are ideal for similarity-based search and embedding-based queries, while knowledge graphs excel in handling structured relationships.
