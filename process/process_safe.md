# Overview of a Solution with Multiple ARTs

## What is a Solution?
A solution in SAFe represents a large product, service, or system delivered to the customer. It often spans multiple Agile Release Trains (ARTs) due to its complexity and scale. These ARTs work collaboratively as part of a **Solution Train**, which orchestrates their efforts to ensure alignment and delivery of value.

---

## Key Elements of a Multi-ART Solution

### 1. Solution Train
- A **Solution Train** is the organizational construct that manages multiple ARTs working together.
- Aligns the ARTs under a single vision, ensuring their contributions integrate into a cohesive solution.
- Includes roles, artifacts, and events specific to large-scale coordination.

### 2. Value Streams
- The solution is typically tied to one or more **Value Streams**, representing the flow of value from concept to delivery.
- Guides the organization of ARTs to ensure they focus on delivering value effectively.

### 3. Coordination Across ARTs
- ARTs working on a solution synchronize through shared objectives, architectural alignment, and events like **Pre- and Post-PI Planning**.
- Dependencies are managed proactively to reduce delays and risks.

---

## Key Roles in a Multi-ART Solution

### Solution Train Roles
1. **Solution Train Engineer (STE):**
    - Facilitates and coordinates the activities of all ARTs within the Solution Train.
    - Analogous to the Release Train Engineer (RTE) but at the solution level.

2. **Solution Manager:**
    - Owns the solution vision and roadmap.
    - Ensures alignment with customer needs and business objectives.

3. **Solution Architect/Engineer:**
    - Guides the technical and architectural integrity of the solution.
    - Collaborates with System Architects from individual ARTs.
