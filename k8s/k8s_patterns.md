## 1. Foundational Patterns
Foundational patterns are essential constructs that help set up the base for deploying applications on Kubernetes.

- **Predictable Demands:** Designing for known usage demands, allowing resources to be allocated effectively.
- **Declarative Deployment:** Using declarative manifests (YAML) to define and deploy applications.
- **Self-Healing:** Leveraging Kubernetes' built-in capabilities for self-healing, such as automatic restarts and rescheduling.
- **Automated Scheduling:** Letting Kubernetes handle scheduling decisions to optimize resource utilization and workload placement.

## 2. Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on managing the application's runtime behavior on Kubernetes.

- **Health Probe:** Using readiness and liveness probes to monitor and manage application health.
- **Predictable Scheduling:** Ensuring applications are placed in predictable locations or nodes.
- **Managed Lifecycle:** Leveraging lifecycle hooks to handle pre- and post-start behaviors.
- **Configuration Resource:** Managing environment-specific configurations, such as with ConfigMaps and Secrets.
- **Resource Management:** Defining resource requests and limits to control application resource usage.

## 3. Structural Patterns
Structural patterns address ways to architect applications and services for modularity, scalability, and resilience.

- **Sidecar:** Extending the functionality of a primary application container by pairing it with auxiliary containers (e.g., logging, monitoring).
- **Adapter:** Creating compatibility layers between services, such as API gateways or protocol translators.
- **Ambassador:** Configuring a helper container that acts as a proxy to external services or APIs.
- **Init Container:** Running one-time setup tasks using Init Containers before starting the main application container.
- **Leader Election:** Ensuring that only one instance of a pod assumes a leadership role in a multi-instance deployment.

## 4. Configuration Patterns
Configuration patterns focus on effectively managing configuration data for cloud-native applications.

- **Configuration Resource:** Using Kubernetes resources like ConfigMaps and Secrets for externalized configuration management.
- **Environment Variable Configuration:** Passing configurations as environment variables to applications, making them more flexible.
- **Configuration Template:** Using templates and parameterized configurations to customize application deployments across environments.

## 5. Advanced Patterns
These patterns are geared towards more sophisticated use cases and deployment scenarios, such as optimizing resource usage and scaling dynamically.

- **Autoscaling:** Leveraging Horizontal Pod Autoscaler and Vertical Pod Autoscaler for dynamic scaling based on load.
- **Stateful Services:** Managing stateful applications with StatefulSets for predictable identities and storage management.
- **Operator:** Using custom controllers (Operators) to extend Kubernetes' API for managing complex applications (e.g., databases).
- **Multi-Cluster Deployment:** Coordinating deployments across multiple Kubernetes clusters for redundancy and global reach.

## 6. Observability Patterns
Observability patterns provide strategies for monitoring, logging, and tracing applications on Kubernetes.

- **Log Aggregation:** Centralizing and managing logs using tools like Fluentd and Elasticsearch.
- **Metrics Collection:** Gathering application and cluster metrics with Prometheus or other monitoring tools.
- **Distributed Tracing:** Implementing tracing across services for visibility into distributed transactions (e.g., with Jaeger or OpenTracing).
- **Health Monitoring:** Using Kubernetes health checks alongside external monitoring solutions for comprehensive system health.
