# Validating and Mutating Webhooks in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, **Validating Webhooks** and **Mutating Webhooks** are part of the **Admission Control** mechanism. They help manage and enforce custom policies on resources before they are persisted in the cluster. These webhooks allow for validation of incoming requests and automatic mutation of resource definitions based on specific rules.

---

## 1. Validating Webhooks

A **Validating Webhook** is used to **validate** the incoming Kubernetes API request. It enforces custom validation rules and rejects requests that do not meet specified criteria.

### How It Works:
- When a request (such as creating or modifying a resource) is made to the Kubernetes API server, it goes through the admission control process.
- If a validating webhook is configured, Kubernetes sends the resource definition to the webhook server for validation.
- The webhook evaluates the request based on custom logic (e.g., checking configurations, security policies, or resource limits).
- If the webhook returns a **deny** response, the resource creation or update is rejected.
- If the webhook returns an **accept** response (or no response), the request proceeds as usual.

### Use Cases:
- Enforcing custom policies on resource creation (e.g., ensuring resources do not exceed certain limits).
- Enforcing security rules (e.g., requiring specific labels on namespaces or enforcing image policies).
- Ensuring that only specific users or service accounts can create certain types of resources.

## 2. Mutating Webhooks

A **Mutating Webhook** allows you to **mutate** or modify the resource definition before it is persisted in the cluster. This means the webhook can automatically adjust the resource configuration (such as adding labels, annotations, or modifying resource requests).

### How It Works:
- When a request is made to the Kubernetes API, the resource passes through the admission control process.
- If a mutating webhook is configured, Kubernetes sends the resource to the webhook server for mutation.
- The webhook server can modify the resource definition (e.g., add labels, change container configurations, or set default values).
- Once the resource is mutated, it is returned to the API server, which processes the request as usual.

### Use Cases:
- Automatically injecting sidecar containers into Pods (e.g., for monitoring or logging).
- Adding default values to missing fields (e.g., setting a default image pull policy).
- Injecting specific security-related configurations into resources (e.g., ensuring that all pods have a specific security context).

## Key Differences Between Validating and Mutating Webhooks

| Feature                         | **Validating Webhooks**                              | **Mutating Webhooks**                                 |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                      | To **validate** requests before they are persisted.  | To **mutate** or **modify** requests before they are persisted. |
| **Operation**                    | Rejects or accepts the request based on custom logic. | Modifies the request and returns the modified resource. |
| **Use Case**                     | Enforcing custom validation rules (e.g., security policies, naming conventions). | Automatically injecting defaults, adding labels, or enforcing security-related configurations. |
| **Response**                     | Return an acceptance or rejection (allow or deny).   | Return the modified resource after the mutation.      |
| **Order of Execution**           | Executed after mutating webhooks and before the resource is persisted. | Executed first, before validating webhooks and before persistence. |

## Webhook Admission Control Flow

1. **Mutating Webhooks**: If mutating webhooks are configured, they are executed first. These webhooks modify the resource as needed and return the mutated resource to the API server.
2. **Validating Webhooks**: After mutating webhooks, validating webhooks are executed. They verify that the resource adheres to custom rules and either accept or reject the resource.
3. **Persistence**: If the resource passes both validation and mutation (if applicable), it is persisted in the cluster.

## How to Configure Webhooks in Kubernetes

Both **Validating** and **Mutating Webhooks** are configured using **Admission Webhook Resources** in Kubernetes.

1. **Define a Webhook Server**: This server listens for requests from the Kubernetes API server, processes the resource data, and returns either a validation or mutated response.
2. **Create a Webhook Configuration**:
    - `MutatingWebhookConfiguration`: For mutating webhooks.
    - `ValidatingWebhookConfiguration`: For validating webhooks.
3. **Configure the Kubernetes API Server**: The API server must be configured to call your webhook server for the relevant resource operations.

## Security Considerations

- **TLS Security**: Both mutating and validating webhooks must communicate over HTTPS to ensure the integrity and security of the data being transferred.
- **Webhook Timeout**: Webhook servers must respond promptly to avoid delays in processing the API request. Kubernetes has a configurable timeout for webhooks.
- **Webhook Failure**: If a webhook fails (e.g., network issues or misconfiguration), it may cause the request to be rejected, depending on the `failurePolicy` setting (either `Fail` or `Ignore`).

## Real-World Kubernetes Examples Using Webhooks

Kubernetes uses **Validating** and **Mutating Webhooks** internally for various important tasks, including security, policy enforcement, and configuration management. Here are a few real-world examples:

### 1. **Pod Security Policies (PSP)**
- **Use Case**: The **PodSecurityPolicy** admission controller uses validating webhooks to ensure that Pods comply with security policies before being created or updated. For example, a policy might prevent Pods from running as root, or enforce the use of read-only file systems for certain containers.
- **How it works**: When a user attempts to create or modify a Pod, the PSP webhook validates whether the Pod meets the defined security requirements. If the Pod does not comply, the request is rejected.

### 2. **Resource Limits and Requests Enforcement**
- **Use Case**: Kubernetes can use a mutating webhook to automatically inject resource requests and limits into Pods that do not specify them. This helps enforce a consistent resource management strategy across a cluster.
- **How it works**: If a Pod does not have memory or CPU limits defined, a mutating webhook can automatically add a default resource limit to the container configuration, ensuring that the Pod runs within the cluster's resource constraints.

### 3. **Namespace Resource Quotas**
- **Use Case**: Kubernetes uses validating webhooks to enforce **resource quotas** at the namespace level, ensuring that a given namespace does not exceed its resource allocation for certain resources like CPU, memory, or storage.
- **How it works**: When creating resources like Pods or Services, the validating webhook checks the requested resources against the configured quotas for the namespace. If the request exceeds the quota, it is rejected.

### 4. **Image Validation and Policy Enforcement**
- **Use Case**: Kubernetes can use validating webhooks to enforce security policies around container images, such as requiring that only images from trusted registries are used.
- **How it works**: The validating webhook inspects the image references in the resource definitions. If the image does not come from a trusted registry (e.g., Docker Hub or a private registry with a signature), the webhook denies the resource creation.

### 5. **Automatic Sidecar Injection**
- **Use Case**: Many service meshes, such as **Istio**, use mutating webhooks to automatically inject sidecar containers (e.g., Envoy proxies) into Pods.
- **How it works**: When a new Pod is created, the mutating webhook detects that the application container does not have a sidecar. The webhook then injects the sidecar container configuration before the Pod is created, ensuring that the sidecar is deployed alongside the application container for traffic management and observability.

### 6. **Defaulting Labels and Annotations**
- **Use Case**: To ensure that resources are consistently labeled and annotated for tracking or categorization purposes, a mutating webhook can automatically add default labels or annotations to resources like Pods, Deployments, and Services.
- **How it works**: If a Pod is created without the required labels (e.g., `app`, `env`, `team`), the mutating webhook injects them automatically, helping to maintain a consistent labeling strategy across all resources.

## Conclusion

- **Validating Webhooks** are primarily used for **validation**, ensuring that incoming requests conform to required policies before being accepted.
- **Mutating Webhooks** are used to **mutate** or modify requests before they are persisted, allowing you to automatically modify or enhance resources based on specific needs.

Together, these webhooks provide a powerful way to enforce policies, automate configuration tasks, and ensure the security and integrity of Kubernetes clusters. Kubernetes itself uses these mechanisms in several important ways, from security policies to automatic configuration, making them essential for managing resources effectively in a production environment.
