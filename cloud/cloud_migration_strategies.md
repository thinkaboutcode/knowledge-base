# Cloud Migration Strategies: The 6 R's

When migrating to the cloud, there are several strategies, commonly referred to as the **6 R's of Cloud Migration**. These approaches help organizations choose the right path based on their business needs, goals, and application requirements.

---

## 1. Rehosting (Lift-and-Shift)
- **Description:** Moving applications, workloads, or systems to the cloud with minimal changes to architecture or code.
- **When to Use:**
    - Tight timelines or budget constraints.
    - Legacy applications that cannot easily be modernized.
    - Organizations looking to test the cloudâ€™s benefits quickly.
- **Pros:**
    - Fast and low-cost initial migration.
    - Minimal disruption to operations.
- **Cons:**
    - Limited ability to leverage cloud-native features.
    - May result in higher operating costs due to inefficiencies.

## 2. Replatforming (Lift-Tinker-and-Shift)
- **Description:** Moving to the cloud with some optimizations to improve performance or cost-efficiency without major architectural changes.
- **Example:** Upgrading a database from a self-managed instance to a managed cloud database (e.g., migrating to AWS RDS).
- **When to Use:**
    - Applications that need minor adjustments for better performance in the cloud.
    - Organizations seeking some cost optimization without full re-architecting.
- **Pros:**
    - Leverages some cloud-native benefits.
    - Faster than a complete refactor.
- **Cons:**
    - More effort required than lift-and-shift.

## 3. Refactoring (Rearchitecting)
- **Description:** Redesigning and redeveloping applications to fully leverage cloud-native features, such as serverless computing, microservices, and autoscaling.
- **Example:** Rewriting a monolithic application as microservices using containers (e.g., Kubernetes) or serverless platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda).
- **When to Use:**
    - Applications that are critical for business and need to scale or modernize.
    - Organizations aiming for cloud-native efficiency and agility.
- **Pros:**
    - Unlocks full cloud benefits like scalability, reliability, and cost savings.
    - Improved application performance and agility.
- **Cons:**
    - High upfront cost and time investment.
    - Requires skilled development teams.

## 4. Repurchasing (Replace)
- **Description:** Replacing an existing application with a cloud-based SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) solution.
- **Example:** Moving from a custom CRM system to Salesforce or from an on-premises email server to Microsoft 365.
- **When to Use:**
    - Applications that are not a competitive differentiator and can be replaced with off-the-shelf solutions.
    - Outdated systems with modern SaaS alternatives.
- **Pros:**
    - Reduces maintenance and operational overhead.
    - Quick adoption of modern tools.
- **Cons:**
    - Potential data migration and user retraining challenges.
    - Loss of customization compared to bespoke solutions.

---

## 5. Retiring
- **Description:** Decommissioning or sunsetting applications or workloads that are no longer needed.
- **When to Use:**
    - Applications or systems with overlapping functionality.
    - Systems that are outdated or no longer serve a business purpose.
- **Pros:**
    - Simplifies the IT landscape.
    - Reduces costs by removing unnecessary workloads.
- **Cons:**
    - Requires a detailed analysis to avoid retiring critical systems inadvertently.

---

## 6. Retaining (Revisit)
- **Description:** Keeping certain applications or workloads in their current environment, either on-premises or in a private cloud, while revisiting their migration at a later time.
- **When to Use:**
    - Systems that rely on sensitive data or have regulatory/compliance constraints.
    - Applications not yet ready for migration due to complexity or dependency issues.
- **Pros:**
    - Avoids forcing unnecessary migrations.
    - Allows time to plan or modernize before migrating.
- **Cons:**
    - May lead to a hybrid environment, increasing complexity.

## Choosing the Right Strategy

The best migration strategy depends on:
1. **Business Goals:** Are you prioritizing speed, cost savings, or modernization?
2. **Application Requirements:** Does the application require significant changes to perform in the cloud?
3. **Resource Availability:** Do you have the budget, time, and skilled personnel for more complex migrations?
4. **Current Environment:** Are you migrating legacy systems, modern applications, or a mix of both?

Often, organizations use a **combination of strategies** for different workloads, tailoring the approach to the needs of each system. This is known as a **hybrid migration strategy**.
