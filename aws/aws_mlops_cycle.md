# Complete MLOps Cycle Using AWS with GitHub Actions

To build a complete MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) cycle using AWS with GitHub Actions, you'll integrate AWS services for model development, deployment, monitoring, and scaling. This cycle includes data preparation, model training, deployment, monitoring, and model management, with CI/CD automation powered by GitHub Actions.

## Architecture Overview

## 1. Data Collection and Storage
- **Amazon S3**: Store large datasets in Amazon S3 buckets. Data can come from various sources such as logs, sensors, web scrapers, or APIs.
- **AWS Glue**: Automate data transformation, cleaning, and cataloging.
- **Amazon RDS / Amazon Redshift**: Store and manage structured data in Amazon RDS (Relational Database Service) or Amazon Redshift (data warehousing).

## 2. Data Preparation
- **AWS Glue**: Use AWS Glue for ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes to clean, transform, and catalog the data.
- **Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler**: Use this service for interactive data preparation, cleaning, and transformation.
- **Amazon S3 Select**: Efficiently retrieve subsets of data from S3 for model training.

## 3. Model Development
- **Amazon SageMaker Studio**: Use SageMaker Studio as an integrated development environment (IDE) for building and training machine learning models.
- **Amazon SageMaker Notebooks**: Use Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model creation, and experimentation.
- **Amazon SageMaker Autopilot**: Enable automatic machine learning (AutoML) for automatic preprocessing, model selection, and training.
- **Amazon SageMaker Algorithms**: Utilize built-in algorithms like XGBoost, TensorFlow, or PyTorch, or bring custom models for training.

## 4. Model Training
- **Amazon SageMaker Training**: Use SageMaker’s managed training infrastructure for distributed training on GPUs or CPUs.
- **Amazon SageMaker Pipelines**: Automate model training, evaluation, and deployment through CI/CD pipelines.
- **Amazon EC2 Instances (Spot Instances)**: Save costs by using EC2 Spot instances for on-demand resources during model training.

## 5. Model Evaluation
- **Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor**: Monitor model performance and detect data drift in predictions.
- **Amazon SageMaker Clarify**: Assess model bias and fairness during training and deployment.

## 6. Model Deployment
- **Amazon SageMaker Endpoints**: Deploy the trained model as an endpoint for real-time inference.
- **Amazon SageMaker Batch Transform**: Use for batch inference when real-time predictions are not required.
- **Amazon API Gateway + Lambda**: Integrate API Gateway and Lambda functions for serverless inference, scaling the model based on demand.

## 7. Model Monitoring and Management
- **Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor**: Continuously monitor deployed models for performance degradation and data drift.
- **Amazon CloudWatch**: Monitor logs, metrics, and create alarms around model performance and infrastructure health.
- **AWS CloudTrail**: Audit model deployment, training, and changes to the infrastructure and resources.

## 8. Model Retraining
- **Amazon SageMaker Pipelines**: Automate the retraining process based on new data or performance thresholds being exceeded.
- **Amazon EventBridge**: Trigger retraining automatically based on events, such as new data uploads to S3 or changes in model performance.

## 9. Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) with GitHub Actions
- **GitHub Actions**: Use GitHub Actions to automate the entire CI/CD pipeline for machine learning models. This includes:
    - **Training Automation**: Automatically trigger model training when code changes are pushed to the repository, using GitHub Actions workflows.
    - **Testing**: Run unit tests, integration tests, and model performance tests as part of the GitHub Actions workflow.
    - **Model Versioning**: Automate versioning of models and push them to Amazon SageMaker Model Registry.
    - **Deployment**: Use GitHub Actions to deploy models to Amazon SageMaker endpoints for real-time inference or to batch processing jobs. This can be done through AWS CLI or SDKs within the GitHub Actions workflow.

## 10. Model Governance and Compliance
- **AWS Config**: Track configuration changes to model deployments and ensure compliance with company policies.
- **AWS IAM**: Use IAM roles and policies to secure access to SageMaker and other AWS resources.
- **Amazon SageMaker Model Registry**: Manage, version, and track models through their lifecycle.
- **AWS Artifact**: Access compliance reports and regulatory documents as needed.

## 11. Scalability and Cost Management
- **Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS)**: Use EKS for containerized model deployment to scale on-demand.
- **AWS Auto Scaling**: Automatically scale SageMaker endpoints based on real-time traffic or computational needs.
- **AWS Cost Explorer**: Monitor and optimize your machine learning infrastructure costs, especially when scaling training jobs or inference instances.

## Example Workflow with GitHub Actions

1. **Data Collection**: Data from logs or web scraping is stored in Amazon S3.
2. **Data Preparation**: AWS Glue performs ETL to clean and transform the data.
3. **Model Training**: Use SageMaker Studio to train a recommendation model.
4. **Model Evaluation**: After training, SageMaker Model Monitor checks the model's performance for drift or bias.
5. **Model Deployment**: Deploy the trained model using SageMaker Endpoints for real-time inference.
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**:
    - Push updates to the model repository triggers a GitHub Actions workflow.
    - The workflow runs tests and retrains the model in SageMaker if necessary.
    - The model is automatically deployed to a SageMaker endpoint using AWS CLI in the GitHub Actions workflow.
7. **Monitoring and Retraining**:
    - CloudWatch and SageMaker Model Monitor track the deployed model’s performance.
    - GitHub Actions can trigger retraining if new data arrives or performance drops below a threshold.

## Automation with GitHub Actions

1. **Model Training**: Use GitHub Actions workflows to automate training when code changes are pushed to the repository. This includes pulling datasets, setting up environments, and training models on Amazon SageMaker.
2. **Model Deployment**: Automate the deployment of new models to production environments using SageMaker Endpoints through GitHub Actions workflows, integrating AWS CLI or SDKs.
3. **Testing**: Automate testing of models and infrastructure within the GitHub Actions workflow to ensure quality and performance before deployment.

By integrating AWS services with GitHub Actions, you can streamline your MLOps cycle, ensuring automated and scalable deployment, testing, and retraining of machine learning models.
