## Key Features of Amazon OpenSearch Service

### Cluster Management
- Fully managed provisioning, patching, scaling, and cluster health monitoring.
- Supports multi-AZ deployments for high availability.

### Version Compatibility
- Supports OpenSearch and legacy Elasticsearch versions up to 7.10.
- Backward compatibility ensures applications built on older Elasticsearch versions can still function.

### Security
- **IAM Integration:** Fine-grained access control for users and services.
