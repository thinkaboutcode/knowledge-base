# Why Use ALB in AWS with Lambda as the Target?

Using an **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** with **Lambda as the target** in AWS can be advantageous in several scenarios. Below is an overview of the key reasons and use cases:

---

## 1. Expose Lambda Functions as HTTP/HTTPS Endpoints
- ALBs can route **HTTP/HTTPS traffic** directly to Lambda functions, making them accessible as standard web endpoints.
- This is a cost-effective alternative to API Gateway for high-throughput scenarios.

---

## 2. Load Balancing for Lambda
- ALB provides **load balancing** for Lambda functions, dynamically invoking instances based on traffic demands.
- Ensures high availability and efficient workload distribution.

---

## 3. Serverless Backend for Web Applications
- Lambda functions can serve as backend compute resources for web or mobile applications.
- No need to provision or manage servers, enabling a fully serverless architecture.

---

## 4. Simplified Integration with ALB Features
- **Path-based routing**: Route requests to different Lambda functions based on the request path (e.g., `/users` → Lambda A, `/orders` → Lambda B).
- **Host-based routing**: Direct traffic to specific Lambda functions based on domains or subdomains.
- **SSL Termination**: ALB handles HTTPS termination, simplifying security for your application.

---

## 5. Event-driven and Stateful Interactions
- ALB supports **session stickiness (cookies)**, enabling stateful interactions with Lambda functions.
- Works well for integrating Lambda with existing applications or microservices expecting HTTP interactions.

---

## 6. Cost-effectiveness
- ALB can be more cost-efficient than API Gateway for high-throughput HTTP traffic.
- Ideal for applications that do not require API Gateway's advanced features (e.g., throttling, caching, API keys).

---

## 7. Ease of Transition from Traditional Backends
- ALB allows for a familiar load balancing setup when transitioning from EC2-based architectures to Lambda.
- Supports hybrid architectures (e.g., EC2 and Lambda behind the same ALB).

---

## Use Cases
1. **Microservices with Lambda**: Handle specific routes as part of a microservices architecture.
2. **Web Applications**: Serve dynamic content or APIs using Lambda behind an ALB.
3. **Event-driven Workflows**: Route user actions from web interfaces to event-driven workflows implemented in Lambda.

---

## Considerations
- **Latency**: Lambda functions may have higher cold-start latency compared to traditional EC2 or containerized backends.
- **Request/Response Limits**: ALB has limits on request/response sizes when using Lambda.
- **Complex APIs**: For advanced API features (e.g., throttling, caching), API Gateway might be a better fit.

---

## Summary
Choosing ALB with Lambda targets enables you to leverage:
- **Scalability**
- **Cost-effectiveness**
- **Simplified routing and load balancing**

This combination is ideal for scenarios requiring serverless computing and HTTP/HTTPS load balancing.
