- Continuously updates with new threat intelligence feeds.

### 3. **Anomaly Detection**
Uses **machine learning** to identify unusual patterns or behaviors in your environment, such as:
- Access attempts from suspicious geolocations.
- Abnormal data transfer volumes.
- Compromised credentials or unusual usage of IAM roles.

### 4. **Multi-Account Monitoring**
Supports centralized security management by enabling GuardDuty across multiple AWS accounts using AWS Organizations.

### 5. **Integration with AWS Security Services**
- **AWS Security Hub**: Aggregate findings from GuardDuty and other AWS security tools.
- **Amazon Detective**: Provides detailed investigation capabilities for GuardDuty findings.
- **AWS Lambda**: Automates remediation based on detected threats.

## **How AWS GuardDuty Works**

1. **Log Analysis**:
    - GuardDuty ingests and analyzes AWS CloudTrail logs, VPC Flow Logs, and DNS query logs for patterns indicative of threats.

2. **Threat Detection**:
    - Leverages machine learning, rule-based detections, and external threat feeds to identify anomalies or known threats.

3. **Findings Generation**:
    - Threats are categorized into **Findings**, which are alerts providing detailed information on the threat, such as severity, affected resources, and suggested remediation steps.

4. **Response Options**:
    - Findings can trigger automated responses using AWS services like Lambda or notify administrators through services like Amazon SNS.

## **Key Benefits of AWS GuardDuty**

1. **No Infrastructure Management**:
    - Fully managed by AWS, eliminating the need to set up, configure, or maintain servers.

2. **Scalability**:
    - Automatically scales with your environment, analyzing large volumes of data without impacting performance.

3. **Cost-Effective**:
    - Pay-as-you-go pricing based on the volume of data processed.

4. **Comprehensive Visibility**:
    - Offers insights across AWS accounts, regions, and services, making it ideal for multi-account organizations.

5. **Seamless Integration**:
    - Works with other AWS security services to create a robust defense-in-depth security strategy.

## **Common Use Cases for AWS GuardDuty**

1. **Detecting Account Compromise**:
    - Identifies unauthorized API calls or unusual IAM activity indicative of compromised credentials.

2. **Protecting Sensitive Data**:
    - Monitors access patterns to ensure that data in S3 or other services is not being exfiltrated.

3. **Monitoring Network Traffic**:
    - Detects unusual network traffic that could indicate malware, botnets, or data breaches.

4. **Compliance and Auditing**:
    - Helps organizations meet compliance requirements by providing detailed security insights and threat detection logs.

# Amazon GuardDuty - Logs Analyzed by Default

Amazon **GuardDuty** automatically analyzes a variety of AWS logs and data sources without requiring explicit configuration or enabling of additional logging. Below is a breakdown of the types of logs and data sources GuardDuty checks by default:

## 1. **VPC Flow Logs**
- **VPC Flow Logs** capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in your VPC.
- **GuardDuty** automatically analyzes these logs to detect anomalies in traffic patterns, such as port scanning, unusual inbound or outbound traffic, and suspicious IP addresses.
- **No explicit enabling required**: GuardDuty integrates with VPC Flow Logs if they are already enabled for your VPC.

## 2. **DNS Logs**
- **Route 53 DNS Logs** provide information about DNS queries made within your AWS environment.
- GuardDuty analyzes DNS logs to detect suspicious behavior like unusual domain name queries (e.g., queries to domains associated with malware or command-and-control servers).
- **No explicit enabling required**: GuardDuty uses data from **Route 53 DNS queries** without the need for additional configuration.

## 3. **CloudTrail Event Logs**
- **AWS CloudTrail** records AWS API calls, including events that happen on your AWS account (e.g., resource changes, user actions, and service usage).
- GuardDuty automatically analyzes **CloudTrail logs** to detect unusual or unauthorized API calls, such as attempts to escalate privileges, misconfigured access, or unexpected access to sensitive resources.
- **CloudTrail is enabled by default** in all AWS accounts, so GuardDuty can analyze these logs as long as CloudTrail is active.

## 4. **AWS CloudTrail S3 Data Events**
- GuardDuty also analyzes **S3 data events** from CloudTrail, which capture detailed API requests for S3 objects.
- This helps detect suspicious S3 access patterns, such as unexpected read or write activity from unusual IP addresses.
- If **S3 data event logging** is enabled in CloudTrail, GuardDuty will automatically monitor them.

## 5. **AWS Network Firewall Logs**
- If you're using **AWS Network Firewall**, GuardDuty will analyze the logs produced by this service, which provide information about the traffic that's filtered by the firewall.
- These logs provide insights into network traffic that is blocked or allowed based on firewall policies.
- **No explicit configuration is needed** to enable GuardDuty to analyze these logs if firewall logs are available.

---

## How GuardDuty Uses These Logs:
- **VPC Flow Logs**: Detects network anomalies, including port scanning, unauthorized traffic patterns, and other network security events.
- **CloudTrail Logs**: Analyzed for unusual API calls that could indicate unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or service misconfiguration.
- **Route 53 DNS Logs**: Detects suspicious DNS queries related to command-and-control activities or domain generation algorithms (DGAs).
- **S3 Data Events**: Identifies unauthorized access to S3 buckets and objects, such as data exfiltration or privilege escalation.
- **AWS Network Firewall Logs**: Analyzed to identify blocked or allowed traffic patterns that could suggest malicious activity or misconfigured security settings.

---

## Summary:
GuardDuty automatically analyzes the following logs **without any additional configuration**:
- **VPC Flow Logs** (if they are enabled in your VPC).
- **Route 53 DNS query logs** (if DNS queries are being made within your account).
- **CloudTrail event logs** (which are enabled by default in all AWS accounts).
- **CloudTrail S3 data events** (if S3 data event logging is enabled).
- **AWS Network Firewall logs** (if you are using AWS Network Firewall and have logging enabled).

To get the most out of GuardDuty, ensure that **CloudTrail** and **VPC Flow Logs** are enabled, and if needed, enable **S3 data event logging** for CloudTrail. These logs provide GuardDuty with the necessary data to detect and alert you about potential security issues.
