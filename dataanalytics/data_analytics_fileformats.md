- **Compression**: Supports efficient compression algorithms (e.g., Snappy, GZip), reducing storage costs.
- **Schema Evolution**: Supports schema updates over time, allowing for flexible data modeling.
- **Interoperability**: Supported by tools like Spark, Hive, Presto, and most modern analytics engines.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Batch processing in big data frameworks (e.g., Spark, Hadoop).
- Querying large datasets in data warehouses and data lakes.
- Optimizing read-heavy analytics workloads.

#### **Best For:**
- Analytical queries on structured data.
- Storing large datasets in cloud platforms (e.g., AWS S3, Azure ADLS, Google Cloud Storage).

### **2. Avro**
**Apache Avro** is a **row-based storage format** that focuses on serialization for large datasets.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Schema Definition**: Data files carry schemas, making it easy to serialize and deserialize.
- **Compact**: Stores data in a compact binary format.
- **Support for Schema Evolution**: Allows changing the schema over time without breaking compatibility.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Streaming data pipelines.
- Messaging systems (e.g., Kafka).
- Data serialization and deserialization for big data applications.

#### **Best For:**
- Write-heavy and streaming workloads.
- Scenarios requiring frequent schema evolution.

### **3. ORC (Optimized Row Columnar)**
**ORC** is another **columnar storage format**, designed for fast reading and efficient compression.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Columnar Storage**: Optimized for analytic queries and high-throughput reads.
- **Compression**: High compression ratios with column-specific encodings.
- **Indexing**: Built-in indexes and statistics improve query performance.
- **Predicate Pushdown**: Reduces the amount of data scanned by queries.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Data warehousing and OLAP workloads.
- Use with Hive or Spark for analytics.

#### **Best For:**
- Efficient queries on large datasets.
- Structured data in data lakes or warehouses.

### **4. JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**
**JSON** is a lightweight, text-based format used for representing structured data.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Human-readable**: Easy to understand and edit.
- **Self-Describing**: Data includes schema-like structures.
- **Wide Compatibility**: Supported by almost all programming languages.

#### **Use Cases:**
- APIs and data exchange between systems.
- Storing semi-structured data.

#### **Limitations:**
- Not optimized for analytics or large datasets.
- Lacks efficient compression and indexing.

#### **Best For:**
- Small-scale data exchange.
- Semi-structured data storage.

### **5. CSV (Comma-Separated Values)**
**CSV** is a simple, text-based format for tabular data.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Simplicity**: Easy to create and process.
- **Compatibility**: Widely supported across applications.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Exporting data from systems for analysis.
- Lightweight data storage.

#### **Limitations:**
- No support for schema or metadata.
- Poor scalability for large datasets.

#### **Best For:**
- Small datasets or one-time data sharing.
- Ad hoc analytics and reporting.

---

### **6. Delta Lake**
**Delta Lake** is an **open-source storage layer** built on top of Parquet, designed to bring **ACID transactions** and **data versioning** to data lakes.

#### **Key Features:**
- **ACID Transactions**: Ensures reliability and consistency of data.
- **Schema Enforcement**: Prevents schema mismatches.
- **Time Travel**: Access historical data versions.
- **Scalable**: Works well with big data tools like Spark.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Data lakes with structured and unstructured data.
- Machine learning pipelines requiring reproducible datasets.
- Scenarios needing governance and transactional guarantees.

#### **Best For:**
- Unified batch and streaming data pipelines.
- Managing large-scale data lakes.

---

### **7. Iceberg**
**Apache Iceberg** is an **open table format** for big data, designed to improve manageability and performance.

#### **Key Features:**
- **Schema Evolution**: Adds or removes fields without breaking existing queries.
- **Partition Pruning**: Efficient queries on specific partitions.
- **ACID Support**: Supports transactional workloads.
- **Metadata Management**: Tracks table snapshots for time travel.

#### **Use Cases:**
- Managing datasets in large data lakes.
- Big data pipelines with Apache Spark, Trino, or Hive.

#### **Best For:**
- Large-scale datasets requiring transactional integrity and schema evolution.
