# Comparing ActiveMQ (OpenWire), AMQP, and MQTT

## Key Differences Between OpenWire, AMQP, and MQTT

| Feature               | **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**         | **AMQP**                                   | **MQTT**                                |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|
| **Primary Use Case**   | Enterprise messaging           | Interoperable, standardized messaging      | Lightweight IoT and device communication|
| **Queues**             | Point-to-point, exclusive consumers | AMQP queues managed via exchanges          | No queues; uses topics for all communication|
| **Topics**             | Pub/Sub model                  | Pub/Sub via exchanges and bindings         | Pub/Sub, hierarchical topic structure   |
| **Durable Subscriptions** | Supported (durable consumers)   | Durable queues bound to exchanges          | Retained messages for topics            |
| **Protocol Type**      | Binary, ActiveMQ-specific      | Binary, standard (ISO/IEC 19464)           | Lightweight, binary, stateful (ISO/IEC 20922)|
| **Routing**            | Native (e.g., Composite Destinations, Virtual Topics) | Flexible (exchange types + routing keys)  | None; directly subscribes to topics     |
| **QoS Levels**         | Reliable with transactions     | Configurable acknowledgments               | QoS 0, 1, 2 (At most once, at least once, exactly once) |
| **Statefulness**       | Stateless                      | Mostly stateless (connection per session)  | Stateful (persistent client sessions)   |
| **Interoperability**   | Limited to ActiveMQ or JMS clients | High (AMQP-compliant clients and brokers) | High (MQTT-compliant brokers and clients)|
| **Client Simplicity**  | Complex                        | Moderate                                   | Extremely simple                        |
| **Resource Use**       | Higher (enterprise-level broker) | Moderate                                   | Minimal (IoT-focused)                   |

## 1. Queue Behavior
- **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**:
  - Queues are point-to-point, meaning one consumer processes a given message.
  - This model is simple and works well for enterprise use cases.
- **AMQP**:
  - Queues exist but are linked to exchanges.
  - An exchange determines how messages are routed to queues, allowing for flexible fanout, filtering, and routing.
- **MQTT**:
  - There are no explicit queues in MQTT. Instead, all messages are sent to topics.
  - A subscribing client can hold persistent sessions to avoid losing messages while offline.

---

## 2. Topic Behavior
- **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**:
  - Topics are used for publish-subscribe patterns.
  - Each subscriber gets a copy of the message. Durable subscriptions allow persistence.
- **AMQP**:
  - Topics are implemented using exchanges (typically topic or fanout exchanges).
  - Each subscriber binds its queue to the exchange and gets a copy of matching messages.
- **MQTT**:
  - Topics are a central part of the protocol.
  - The structure supports hierarchical levels (e.g., `sensors/temperature/device1`) and wildcard subscriptions.
  - Retained messages ensure that new subscribers immediately receive the last retained message for a topic.

---

## 3. Durable Subscriptions
- **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**:
  - Durable subscriptions retain messages even if the subscriber is offline.
  - They require the consumer to explicitly register for durability.
- **AMQP**:
  - Durable subscriptions are achieved by binding durable queues to an exchange.
  - Messages stay in the queue until consumed.
- **MQTT**:
  - Durable subscriptions rely on **persistent sessions**.
  - Subscribers can reconnect and retrieve missed messages. Retained messages on topics allow persistent information dissemination.

---

## 4. Protocol Characteristics
- **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**:
  - Optimized for Java and JMS clients with built-in enterprise features.
  - Complex but tightly integrated with the broker.
- **AMQP**:
  - A flexible, open standard that prioritizes interoperability.
  - It works well for systems that span multiple environments and brokers.
- **MQTT**:
  - A lightweight protocol designed for resource-constrained devices.
  - It’s optimized for low-bandwidth and high-latency networks, such as IoT scenarios.

---

## 5. Message Routing
- **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**:
  - Routing is native to ActiveMQ and includes advanced features like Virtual Topics, Composite Destinations, and selectors.
- **AMQP**:
  - Exchanges are the core of routing.
  - Different exchange types (direct, fanout, topic, headers) allow sophisticated routing strategies.
- **MQTT**:
  - There’s no formal routing. Publishers send to topics, and subscribers define what they want to receive by subscribing to those topics.

---

## 6. Quality of Service (QoS)
- **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**:
  - Reliable messaging with transaction support.
  - Acknowledgments and redelivery are handled at the broker level.
- **AMQP**:
  - Offers configurable acknowledgment modes (manual, auto, prefetch limits) and supports transactional messaging.
- **MQTT**:
  - Designed for simplicity:
    - **QoS 0**: At most once (fire-and-forget).
    - **QoS 1**: At least once (guaranteed delivery, possible duplicates).
    - **QoS 2**: Exactly once (no duplicates, higher overhead).

---

## 7. Interoperability
- **ActiveMQ (OpenWire)**:
  - Tied to ActiveMQ clients or JMS libraries.
- **AMQP**:
  - High interoperability. AMQP 1.0 clients can work with any AMQP-compliant broker.
- **MQTT**:
  - Extremely interoperable. MQTT clients can connect to any compliant broker (e.g., ActiveMQ, Mosquitto, HiveMQ).

## 8. Use Case Focus

| Protocol  | Primary Use Cases                                  |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **OpenWire** | Enterprise messaging, tight JMS integration        |
| **AMQP**     | Enterprise messaging, heterogeneous systems, cloud |
| **MQTT**     | IoT, mobile devices, real-time telemetry           |
